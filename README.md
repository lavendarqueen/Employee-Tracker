## Description

Employee Tracker is a content management system that is run from the command line interface (CLI) using node.js, Inquirer, and PosetgreSQL to manage a company's employees database. Building this project taught me how to use the aforementioned libraries to create a CLI application. The project gives the user the ability manage their personnel records by inputting queries to view a formatted table of all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

## Installation

Installation of Employee-Tracker required importing the following libraries:

1. npm i
2. npm install pg
3. npm i inquirer@8.2.4

## Usage

Import of the libraries described above has already been done. The user needs only to enter the following input in the command line:

node server.js

A list of the functions mentioned in the description above appears and the user can select a function, such as "add an employee" using the down arrows on the keyboard. Employee-Tracker performs the function. The user can then verify the result by using the up/down arrows to view all employees as seen in the following screenshots.
